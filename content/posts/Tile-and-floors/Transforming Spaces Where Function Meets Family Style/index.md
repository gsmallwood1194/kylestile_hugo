### Brief Introduction

* **Prioritize Functionality**: When designing your kitchen or bathroom, think about how you and your family will use the space. Do you need more counter space for food preparation or additional storage for toys and supplies?
* **Choose Durable Materials**: Select materials that are not only stylish but also durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of daily family life.
* **Incorporate Storage**: Ample storage is essential for keeping your home organized and clutter-free. Consider creative storage solutions like built-in shelves or hidden compartments.
